            is at least (h - 1) high.  Our strategy here is to find the 
            tree with (n - 1) nodes where the right tree is of height
            (h - 1) and the right tree has the least possible number of 
            nodes in it.  This means that the left tree will have the
            most possible nodes in it. How many nodes are in the right tree? *)

           cannot be h, because then we would be able to construct a left tree
           of size h, a right tree of size (h - 1), and a total tree of size 
           (h + 1), but the assumption was that we have found the highest possible
           tree with (n - 1) nodes. So we only have enough nodes on the left side
           to construct a tree with height (h - 1), tops. *)
       
        (* Suppose we add a node to the left hand side, making the total
           number of nodes in the tree n.  We keep the right side the
           same lightest possible subtree of height (h - 1). Can we 
           reorganize the (max_subtree + 1) nodes on the left into a tree
           of height h? 
           
           If yes then we can construct a height-balanced tree of height
           h on the left and (h-1) on the right, which is a tree of total 
           height (h + 1).  
           
           If no then even with the lightest possible tree on the right side
           we still can only get the left side to have height (h - 1) when
           we add a node to it. 
           
           Again we make the recursive assumption that we can solve the smaller
           problem. *)

        (* Let's consider an example. How high is the highest tree with 7 nodes?
           We assume that we have a solution for the highest tree with 0 through 6
           nodes. The highest possible tree with 6 nodes is 3 high. That means that
           at least one side is 2 high (in fact they both are.)  Suppose the right
           side is 2 high and as light as possible; the lightest possible tree of
           height 2 has 2 nodes in it.  That leaves 3 nodes for the left side. Suppose
           we added a 4th node to the left side; could we make a tree of height 3?
           Yes! Therefore the maximum height of a tree with 7 nodes has height 3 on
           one side and height 2 on the other. 
           
           Now how high can we make a tree with 8 nodes? The highest tree with 7
           nodes has height 3 on the high side. What's the least number of nodes
           in that tree? We can make a 4-node tree of height 3. That means that 
           in the highest tree with 7 nodes, we have at most 2 nodes on the 
           light side. Can we add a third and rearrange that into a tree of
           height 3? No. So the highest we can make a tree with 8 nodes is the 
           same as the highest we can make a tree with 7 nodes: 3 high. *)
